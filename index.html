### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs, so it is one of the three I chose to write about. It was one of my favorites because it was my first time really coding and it was very simple when you do something you love first times are always special and it was better since I did not have to struggle too much. This lab I learned the basics of coding and put them into practice it helped cement what I learned in class. 
* Lab 2
    
    Lab 2 is the second lab I chose to talk about. I did not like it as much as lab 1 but it was still good in my eyes, I found lab 2 interesting because it was the first time, we had to do multiple parts and it was tougher than I thought it would be for one of our early labs. This lab was still trying to figure out the basics and switching between directories which was something I was still struggling with and trying to figure out until this lab. 
* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part-2 is the last lab I am going to write about, and it is my second favorite lab overall. It is one of the most recent labs we did so it was tougher than what we have done before but I still found it simple and relaxing and me being to relax while working on this tough lab makes it one of my favorite labs. This lab I do not think I learned much just cementing everything from the whole semester.
